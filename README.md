1. Gain the expected numbers of primary infections and relapses by covariate category and two-month time interval 
2. Estimate the probability of clinical illness from expected numbers of primary infections and relapses (with cumulative primary infections and covariates)
3. Predict age-incidence curves for different tranmsission intensities (using OpenMalaria)
