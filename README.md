Code and data for the manuscript <em>"The probability of Plasmodium vivax acute malarial illness following primary infection and relapse in Papua New Guinea"</em>
<em>PLOS Negl Trop Dis</em>, 2025, <em>in press</em>

1. Expected numbers of primary infections and relapses
   - Code to output the expected numbers of primary infections and relapses by covariate category and two-month time interval   
2. Estimate the probability of clinical illness from expected numbers of primary infections and relapses (with the cumulative number of primary infections experienced, and covariates)
3. Predict age-incidence curves for different transmission intensities and treatment coverages (embed the vivax components in OpenMalaria and compare the predictions with observed data from different settings)
