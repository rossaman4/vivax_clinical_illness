##### vivax_clinical_illness: The probability of <em>Plasmodium vivax</em> acute malarial illness following primary infection and relapse in Papua New Guinea 



1. Expected numbers of primary infections and relapses
   - Outputs the expected numbers of primary infections and relapses by covariate category and two-month time interval
   
2. Estimate the probability of clinical illness from expected numbers of primary infections and relapses (with the cumulative number of primary infections experienced, and covariates)
3. Validate by predicting age-incidence curves for different transmission intensities and treatment coverages (using OpenMalaria) and comparing with data from different settings
