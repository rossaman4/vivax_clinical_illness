### 3. Age-incidence curves (Figure 5)

The age-incidence curves for clinical episodes are simulated using _OpenMalaria_, a comprehensive simulation model for malaria dynamics and interventions. The vivax component corresponding to this manuscript has been included in the _OpenMalaria_ source code (from version 48).

The scenarios and output files are in /scenarios. 

If you would like to rerun the scenarios:

The wiki for _OpenMalaria_ is available at: https://github.com/SwissTPH/openmalaria/wiki. The simulations here were carried out using version 48. 
To download and compile, follow the HowTo in the User guide or the Expert guide (from the menu on the right-hand side).

The R script _fig5.r_ takes the output files and plots the predicted age-incidence curves.
